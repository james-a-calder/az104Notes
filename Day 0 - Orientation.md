- Labs are valid for 6 months.
- You have 10 attempts for each lab.
- Each session has an expiration time so keep an eye on the timer. There will be a popup warning when the time nears, you will have a option to extend your session if needed (This can only be done once).
- Labs can not be saved midway through, you either have to finish it or abandon the attempt.

In the instructions tab, tick off the steps as you go. This tells you how long is left and also acts as a bookmark if the machine has to be rebooted.

The cleanup resources task do not need to be run if you are using the lab's VM and portal credentials as the subscription gets auto scrubbed on ending the lab. These instructions are for those using their own subscriptions.

It is not possible to copy cut or paste using the conventional methods. If you need to copy or paste, you can click on the lightning bolt go to copy text and select copy clipboard text to open a dialog box you can paste into.

**Confirm in teams meeting when you have completed the lab.**

### Troubleshooting issues
- If you get a dropout/if the remote session hangs, there is a button at the top left with a reconnect option. This will refresh the RDP connection.
- If there is no Internet access then click the lightning logo and then click `Reset Internet Gateway`.
- If it totally fails/dosen't work contact support on the portal to log the issue. They will refund the attempt it it can not be remedied
